- INFO & FAQ -

Q) Will the pack update every time something new is added?
A) You will need to re-download the resource pack if you would like any new features to be added. It is not automatically updated ingame unfortunately.

Q) Can you port this to bedrock
A) It is a work in progress and hopefully planned to be available on the marketplace around autumn time 

Q) Can I use this pack for my modpack/video/personal pack/ect...
A) My answer will always be yes, under the condition credit is properly given with a link to the pack's original curseforge site https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/faithless

Q) Can you make an items/gui/block/ect... only version? I dont like "x"
A) You may edit the pack yourself if you know how. I dont have plans on breaking up a project I worked hard to put together, at least not until I can afford my own website

Q) Why does my version look different than yours?
A) Could be one of 3 reasons. Either 
		1 - your version is outdated and requires to be redownloaded on the official site : https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-pa
		2 - An addon was being used, which allows some personal preference customization. addons are found here https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/faithless/files
		3 - You dont have optifine installed, or if you do then some settings may not be set up properly
